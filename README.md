# DynamicPix
A nonogram puzzle dynamically assembled. You only need to fill 2 fields in the index.html:
- $COLORS (line 8): Hexadecimal color list of a maximum of 8 elements. The first color must necessarily be white (#ffffff).
- $DATA (line 9): Matrix of numbers from 0 to 7 that represent the position of the colors in the nonogram. The number 0 will always be assigned a white color.
